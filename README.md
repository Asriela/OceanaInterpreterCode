These files make up the interpreter for Oceana. 
It takes text files each of which are a seperate ai behaviour, such as eat, sleep or build house.
The text file doesnt just define what actions the npc must do but also defines how the scoring works for that behaviour.
The scoring is used as part of the games score based state machine, to decide which behaviour to act out next.
